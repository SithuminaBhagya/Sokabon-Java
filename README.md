# Sokabon-Java
This is a modified code of the https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Sokoban-Game.
I have added few changes so that the game can have multiple levels.
In my version it has 5 levels.
After each level is completed total number of moves the user completed to finish the level is displayed.
you can move between levels by clicking 'Enter'.


To change the number of levels and the lay out go to src/Sokoban/Board.java file.
go to line 32 change numLevels to the number of levels you want.
Accordingly add the layouts. layout is inside the []levels array.
one item represents one level.

change the code accordingly and have fun !
